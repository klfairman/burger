# Burger App

-This app was created using MySQL, Node, Handlebars, and a homebrewed ORM.  Node and MySQL were used to query and route data, while Handlebars was used to generate HTML.



# How The App Should Work
Burger APP is a restaurant app that allows users to input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a Eat Your Burger button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. The app stores every burger in the database, whether devoured or not.
